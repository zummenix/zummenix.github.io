Especially, when you don't have other ways available to observe changes on some properties of an object. For those who have never used KVO and not familiar with it I'm gently asking to read about it in Apple documentation first. I won't explain it here. I only add a small note: several years ago Apple introduced a new KVO API which is definitely safer to use comparing to the old one. In this post we are looking only into the new one. Ok, let's proceed.<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Recently, I was working on an iOS project where KVO was implemented some time ago. Worked fine. Not a single problem. But after some changes, completely unrelated, the app started crashing. A stack trace showed a culprit which undeniably was the part with KVO.<p>Let's dive in into the code.<pre class=language-swift data-lang=swift style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-swift data-lang=swift><span style=color:#b48ead>class</span><span> Store: NSObject {

</span></code></pre><p>Let me explain what is going on. We have two classes here. One of them is called <code>Store</code> which has some properties that we want to observe. The second is called <code>Status</code>, the actual observer, an abstraction that is hidden under protocol (not shown here for simplicity). The <code>Store</code> is actually implemented in Objective-C, but this part is irrelevant here. The <code>Status</code> has a method <code>func subscribe(onChange: @escaping () -> Void) -> AnyObject</code>. The method is just a wrapper for the KVO's <code>observe</code> method with some minor logic.<p>Do you smell anything "funny" here? I don't (at least initially). Look, even notifications about changes are propagated on the main queue.<h2 id=a-crash>A Crash</h2><p>A crash was happening in some situations when other parts of our codebase were changing <code>isValid</code> property of the <code>Store</code> instance. <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> exception. It means it is a memory management error. The stack trace showed an internal private function <code>_NSSetBoolValueAndNotify</code> of the objc runtime. I had no idea what it was.<p>The situation was complicated by several factors. First of all, the crash wasn't reproducible in debug builds, only in release builds. Second, to crash you need to tap-tap-tap and click-click-click through several screens and buttons. By following steps our QA gave me, I've spent many many hours trying to reproduce the crash. No luck. Until I've decided to enable "Zombie Objects" in xcode's scheme Diagnostics tab. After all, the crash is clearly related to the memory management. Then, followed the QA's steps again and boom, the Crash! But why though?<h2 id=why>Why?</h2><p>After some more hours looking into debugger, checking out lifetimes of objects, I finally got a vague idea what was going on. My assumption was that the <code>Status</code> object was deallocated before the observation that we return in the <code>Status.subscribe(_:)</code> method. Ok, let's write a unit test for this. Luckily, we had some unit tests already and adding one more was an easy task.<pre class=language-swift data-lang=swift style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-swift data-lang=swift><span style=color:#b48ead>class</span><span> KVOTests: XCTestCase {

</span></code></pre><blockquote><p>If you want to repeat it yourself at home, you probably need to enable the "Zombie Objects" setting for tests.</blockquote><p>Basically, here we are emulating the situation when the <code>Status</code> (<code>sut</code>) object is deallocated before the <code>observation</code>. I've pointed out where the crash is happening by the comment <code>Should not crash here.</code>. Now we have a failing test. Good! Classic TDD. I love it! Let's get it green.<h2 id=a-fix>A Fix</h2><p>We need to, somehow, extend the lifetime of the <code>Status</code> object to be at least the same as our <code>observation</code>. Of course, we could change how we use it in our codebase to make sure that <code>Status</code> instances were alive longer, but there weren't any guarantees that other developers will not run into a similar problem again. I want to avoid it and fix it once and for all. And I was feeling a slight guilt because it was me who had implemented this abstraction in the first place :)<p>One way to extend the lifetime of the <code>Status</code> object is to return it along side the <code>observation</code>. Let's do that by adding a private class which would combine observer and observation together:<pre class=language-swift data-lang=swift style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-swift data-lang=swift><span style=color:#b48ead>private class</span><span> Observation {
</span><span>    </span><span style=color:#b48ead>private var</span><span> observation: NSKeyValueObservation?
</span><span>    </span><span style=color:#b48ead>private var</span><span> observer: Status?
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style=color:#b48ead>init</span><span>(observation: NSKeyValueObservation?, observer: Status?) {
</span><span>        </span><span style=color:#b48ead>self</span><span>.observation = observation
</span><span>        </span><span style=color:#b48ead>self</span><span>.observer = observer
</span><span>    }
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style=color:#b48ead>deinit</span><span> {
</span><span>        </span><span style=color:#65737e>// Order is important.
</span><span>        observation?.invalidate()
</span><span>        observation = </span><span style=color:#d08770>nil
</span><span>        observer = </span><span style=color:#d08770>nil
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>I think the code is clear and doesn't need an explanation. Let's create the <code>Observation</code> in our <code>Status.subscribe(_:)</code> method and return it. Here is the diff:<pre class=language-diff data-lang=diff style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-diff data-lang=diff><span>    func subscribe(onChange: @escaping () -> Void) -> AnyObject {
</span><span>        let observation = observe(\.store.isValid, options: [.new, .old]) { _, change in
</span><span>            if change.oldValue != change.newValue {
</span><span>                DispatchQueue.main.async {
</span><span>                    onChange()
</span><span>                }
</span><span>            }
</span><span>        }
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>-       return observation
</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>+       return Observation(observation: observation, observer: self)
</span><span>    }
</span></code></pre><p><code>Cmd+U</code> and... The test has passed. Nice! Yep, and the app is running fine now.<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Do you remember times where the old KVO observation API was hard to use without encountering random crashes? Those times are still here. Maybe, the situation is a little bit better, but still... Really, this behaviour isn't documented anywhere (at least I haven't found it). I guess, at Apple nobody foreseen that the API will be used this way where the observer is not the object who keeps the observation. The fix works for us and I hope I haven't introduced other bugs here. So, please still be careful using KVO in your projects.</main><footer><p>© 2025 Aleksey Kuznetsov.
